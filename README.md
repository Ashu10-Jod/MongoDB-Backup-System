Automated MongoDB Backup System
ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Automated MongoDB Backup System is a solution designed to simplify and automate the process of database backups. It ensures that critical MongoDB data is securely stored and protected against data loss.

The system uses PowerShell scripts to perform automated backups with mongodump, compresses the files for storage efficiency, and securely uploads them to Google Drive using rclone. With Windows Task Scheduler, the entire backup process can run automatically at scheduled intervals, eliminating manual work.

This project is highly beneficial for students, developers, and organizations that rely on MongoDB, as it ensures data safety, reliability, and efficiency.

âœ¨ Key Features

âœ… Automated Backup â€“ No manual intervention required.

âœ… MongoDB Integration â€“ Uses mongodump for efficient backup.

âœ… Cloud Storage â€“ Uploads backups to Google Drive via Rclone.

âœ… Error Handling â€“ Logs errors and ensures backup consistency.
